# maximize learning from screencasts
## information digest
- organize a folder for each course taken with a **README.md** file, an **exercises** folder, and a **doc-images** folder
- tight up the screencast sections/subsections with headings/subheadings on the README.md
- passive learning vs taking notes
- take note on important information **on my own words**
- write code is powerful!
- take screenshots for more visual projects
- tangents, geeking out something that is not cover on the course just out of curiosity. after that, take note on the discoveries!
- reference code snippet, screenshots, and tangents on the README.md
- find a window arrangement that works for you and stick to it
- remember! 2 hour course may sound doable in one afternoon, but you're not just watching, you are taking notes and using more mental
- find a good amount of learning per day. that avoids getting bored quickly and you stay curious for the next day
- create a habit with small amounts of studies. for example, 10 minute study every tuesday, wednesday, and thursday after launch
- expect to find issues, that's normal thing when learning things
- take notes on troubleshootings




## passive vs active learning

see [[passive vs active learning]]




## organize

create a folder for each course

create a **README.md** file, an **exercises** folder, and a **doc-images** folder

on the README.md file create headings and subheadings that match the course major sections and it's subsections




## arrange windows

once you find an optimal window layout, stick to it for screencast learning




## take notes

see [[take notes - screencast]]




## write code

there's something very powerful in writing code

pause the video, write the code, then review what you've write and make sure you understand every line

another good approach is to pause the video as soon as the instructor announce something. try to solve the announcement by your self and compare the solutions

link those codes on the README.md




## save screenshots for visual courses




## expect issues

sometime you will run into varied problems. such as:

1. **bug in your code**. the root cause of many issues

2. **versions mismatches**. go back to the beginning and check if there's a mention to the version

3. **os mismatch**

4. **bug in the course**. like a video editing that cut by accident some part of the video

take note on the issues

most important, try not to get frustrated

encountering issues is like real life development




## tangents

the good thing about screencasts is that you can pause and search for things that piques your interest

take note on the discoveries




## break it up

sometimes it may sound that a 2-3 hour course is doable in a morning. don't go that way

remember that you're taking notes, exercising, go on tangents, and fix issues

there's a limit of information the brain can absorb all at once. find the right amount of section per learning session

> I've found that doing one or at most two subsections in a single learning session is just the right amount to optimize absorbing new information




## make it a habit

sometimes after a spike of enthusiasm, the learning drops off

make it a habit!
