# spaced repetition

this note aims to track my studies in order to **refresh memories** of those studies **just before they fade**. **instead of review all at once**, the spaced repetition method tells us to **spaced it out over time**

this is a form of **active learning** as oppose to passive learning. by being active learning we will **retain more information**, have **higher learning quality**, **strength our brain connections**
