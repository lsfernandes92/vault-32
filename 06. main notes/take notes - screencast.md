# take notes

every time an important information is given, take notes **on your own words**

the power of taking notes is that makes you remember that you learned the topic even if don't remember the details

screencast is a great way to learn, but it's slow for recall. you'll find yourself searching through the videos in order to get the information that you want. that's why taking notes is important!
