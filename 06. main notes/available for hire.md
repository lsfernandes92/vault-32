# available for hire

## I'm available for hire

I'm a Software Engineer with over **5 years of experience** with a special focus on **Ruby on Rails** and **SaaS products**.

I can **communication effectively**, I'm a **passionate learner**, I **love sharing my discoveries** and help those around me. I'm looking for **remote or on-site** **Mid-level** or **Semi-Senior** Software Engineer roles, either **part-time** or **full-time**.

What I can offer:

**Strengthen and scale your backend with confidence.** I bring solid experience working with microservices architecture. I understand the challenges and trade-offs of it. I can design, maintain and scale them in a way that supports your business goals.

**Supercharge your APIs.** I've worked across complex systems where external APIs play a central role. Whether you're integrating with third-party partners, improving internal APIs, or enhancing the developer experience, I’m ready to help you with that.




## What I can contribute to your team

**I can communicate effectively**. Working for startups and US-based clients help me refine my ability to communicate effectively across the various stakeholders and deliver high-quality products. As a software engineer, my work goes beyond writing code. It's about crafting solutions through clear communication.

**I'm a passionate learner**. As software engineer, I deal with uncertainties at least two or three times a week. When I don't know something I just say it, but I also know how to find the solution. In these cases I check the documentation, I do my own research and I reach out people to point me in the right direction. It's always a new opportunity to learn something new!

**I love sharing my discoveries.** This is active learning at its best. By staying engaged I retain more information, I have higher learning quality, I strengthen my brain connections. I always appreciate when whether my commit messages, PR descriptions, or documentation turn out clear and helpful. It's so satisfying!

## FAQ

#### What do I seek in my new dream job?

A place where I can feel comfortable to leverage my skills as a developer, as I think I still have a lot to learn.

To that end, I am looking for a company with flexible and collaborative people. **Teamwork is where I shine**. I've found that teamwork allows me to learn quickly and leads to better outcomes.




#### When are you available?

I'm available to start **immediately**!




#### How would I describe my style of coding?

I enjoy expressing my ideas through code that is **easy and pleasing to read**. I believe code should guide you through its abstractions to understand what's happening without much effort instead of you try hard to connect the pieces. I value **expressiveness**, ensuring that objects or methods serve a **single purpose**, **abstract code** that has been duplicated and naming things with **meaningful names**. I also emphasize the importance of writing **tests**, as they provide peace of mind when changing code. From my experience working with APIs, I’ve learned to really value clear, **well-documented APIs** that offer a great developer experience.




#### What have I been doing lately?

Currently, I've been balancing my days around these three things lately: studying **programming**, improving my **drawing** skills and **cycling**. I view these activities outside of work positively because they put me in contact with other people and each one brings a different feeling. And, of course, this also reflects positively on my work.




#### Current area of study

At the time of writing, I’ve been exploring how the latest versions of Rails handle the front-end ecosystem to build reactive applications using **Hotwire** and **Turbo** features. At the same time, I’m also studying **software architecture patterns** to improve how I design and structure applications.
