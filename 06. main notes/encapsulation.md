# encapsulation

expose what's necessary and hide what isn't

the ability to hide the internals of a class

you will interact with a class only through well named methods 

it's good to protect data from outside class and controlled access reasons we don't want to expose attributes nor methods from classes

makes the code easier to read, maintain and testing
