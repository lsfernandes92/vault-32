# software design who? 🎨
> Software design (often called detailed design) focuses on how those individual components or modules are implemented in the actual structure.

> Design translates the abstract architecture into actionable implementation details that developers can build.

- more like a granular view of the components
- translates the architecture structure into smaller actionable item to be implemented
- focus com fine tunes within those defined components



### Key aspects

- Detailed implementation: specifies internal logic
- Component behavior: focuses on the functionality
- Ensures seamless collaboration/interaction between modules
- Ensures fine tune optimizations



### Example: e-commerce platform

#### Key considerations

- Design the back-end services such as the catalog service
- API design well design and documented apis to smooth communication between modules
- Implement the algorithms like the search algorithm
- Ensure the database has the right indexes in order to better perform queries on certain fields
