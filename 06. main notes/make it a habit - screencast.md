# make it a habit

sometimes after a spike of enthusiasm, the learning drops off

make it a habit!

here are some techniques




## small amounts regularly

for example, 10 minute study every tuesday, wednesday, and thursday after lunch

it may sound little, but the key here is the **regularly**

> For example, 10 minutes a day, 3 times per week is a half hour. In a year (let's say approximately 50 weeks, accounting for some vacation), that's 25 hours

also after some regularly would be easy to find yourself stretching out the 10 to 20 minute. especially if you're enjoying

you don't need to finish the whole section. just write it down a note for you to remember the next day




## make it easy

make it easy to start

leave the editor open with the course folder

leave the course tab open on your browser




## habit stacking

find a well establish habit in your day and stack the new habit that you want

the general form is:
"After I `CURRENT_HABIT`, I will `NEW_HABIT`."

in the case of screencast learning:
"After I make coffee each morning, I will set down my mug at my desk, and have coffee while doing some screencast learning"

this works because you tie a habit you already doing with a desirable new habit
