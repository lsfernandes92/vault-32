# software architecture who? üèóÔ∏è

> Software architecture acts as the backbone of modern applications, orchestrating how systems are designed, built, and scaled. The right architecture not only enhances performance and ensures scalability but also preserves flexibility for evolving requirements, allowing applications to adapt seamlessly over time.

- acts as a blueprint of the system as a whole
- software architecture gives you a big picture of the system how it's design, build, and scale
- it helps maintaining and evolve with future requirements
- software architecture not only enhances performance and it helps with the scalability



> Software architecture also plays a pivotal role in managing complexity and maintaining availability.

> By defining clear principles, reusable patterns, and standardized interactions among software components, a well-designed architecture demystifies complexity, enabling smoother collaboration and reducing the risk of miscommunication.

- a good software architecture defines patterns, interactions between components relationships, and demystifies complexity



### Key aspects

- Blueprint as a whole
- Cares about the functional and non-functional requirements
- It helps with guidance on patterns and constraints to follow
- It also cares about the evolution of the system to meet the actual and future requirements



### Example: e-commerce platform 
#### Key considerations

- Components: defines the system key elements such as the client browser/mobile, the back-end services and databases
- Communication: defines how the components will talk with each other
- Scalability: ensures that the system will support black-friday periods
- Security: ensures robust measures on sensitive data
- Deployment: defines whether the app will be served on-promises, or on cloud services like AWS
