# component-based architecture üîß

### information digest
- is a pattern where the system is divided into smaller components that together form a whole application
- each component is independent(encapsulation) and reusable(fast development time)
- because each component is self-contained, it's easier for maintaining, extend and updating
- interoperability is the key. we need to ensure a smooth communication between components
- this pattern also imposes latency communication between components
- debugging is easier
- test the system as a whole is difficult
- is good if you want scalable and flexible system
- is good if you need reusable components for large application or multiple projects
- particularly, it's very common use on front-end modern technologies such as Vue, React and Angular



### overview
> Component-Based Architecture (CBA) is a design methodology where software is structured into ==independent, reusable components== that can be assembled to create a complete application. Each component is responsible for a specific functionality, and these modular units can be easily updated, maintained, or replaced without affecting the rest of the system.



> Component-based architecture has gained popularity due to its flexibility, maintainability, and ease of integration



### well suitable for
- **modern web development**
- **modular applications** such as wordpress
- **microservices** as the services is treated as components
- if the focus is on **scalability**
- when focus on long-term **maintainability**
- when **reusability** is the key
- for **large teams** or **parallel development**



### key characteristics
- **modularity**: encapsulates specifics
- **reusability**: reducing redundancy and accelerating development
- **interoperability**: smooth communication to grant flexibility and scalability
- **loose coupling**: standardized interfaces, and changes don't ripple throughout the entire system
- **encapsulation**: scale applications



### benefits
- reusability
	- faster development: reusing components
	- consistency: interfaces remain consistent
	- cost efficiency: reduces development costs
- maintainability
	- isolated updates: self-contained components without ripple changes throughout the entire system
	- clear code organization
	- easier debugging
- parallel development
	- team collaboration: work on different components
	- decentralized ownership: 
- scalability
	- horizontal scaling
	- adaptability



### challengs/trade-offs
- **integration complexity**: interoperability can became complex due to the effort to seamlessly integrate components
- **overhead**: it's hard to keep track of the versions, dependencies of the various components
- **performance**: due to the latency introduced by the various components communication
- **testing**: individual components and the whole


### why it gain it popularity?
due to it flexibility, maintainability, and ease integration



### why it improves efficiency and scalability?
because components are well encapsulate and loosely coupled. also because it's easier to maintain, expand, and update. it's efficient because it's impose gains in the development time



### why the interoperability is the key for this pattern?
smooth communication between components are the key to maintaining the scalability and flexibility of the system



### why the performance is a pain in the ass for this pattern?
because of the frequent communication between components



### why it promotes maintainability?
because of the code organization, the component self-contained and isolated updates, easier for debugging
