## things to keep in mind

those type of programming questions **is not easy**!

it takes **repetition** and **practice**




## at the beggining

focus **learn solutions** rather than solve questions

learn different patterns within a topic

learn common edge cases

create two list of exercises. one list you should focus on learn common solutions and the other list you must practice what you've learned

get good at learning the patterns




## on interviews

the solution you need is the solution you need to pass, and not the best nor the best performant one

engage the interviewer

share your thought process

walk them through what you're coding

share attention between thinking and talking is harsh, but you naturally get better at this




## spend 30 to 60 minutes struggling with the problem

if you still stuck lookup the solution




## understand why something works




## common patterns

- strings
	- two pointers
	- 




## practice with time limit fi struggling to solve problems under time limit




## get slowly better on the common easy/medium questions
